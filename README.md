* [IOBScan](https://ibc.iobscan.io/)

* [Map of Zones](https://mapofzones.com/?period=24) - [Source](https://github.com/mapofzones)
* [Mintscan](https://hub.mintscan.io) - Interchain Explorer by Cosmostation.

## Chain Registry

A registry containing standardized metadata from most Cosmos chains.

* [Cosmos Directory](https://cosmos.directory) - [Source](https://github.com/eco-stake/cosmos-directory)
* [cosmology-tech/chain-registry](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/chain-registry) - A npm package for the official Cosmos Chain Registry.

## Validators

Popular block explorers provide a list of active validators. The easiest entry point to view validator profiles is from a block explorer:

* [List on Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators)
* [List on ATOMScan](https://atomscan.com/validators)
* [List on BigDipper](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/validators)
* [List on Kujira POD](https://pod.kujira.app/cosmoshub-4)

DYOR when choosing a validator. Consider delegating your tokens to validators outside of the top 20 to increase the decentralization of the network.
This is also a good pratice to avoid 0% commission validators and exchange validators.

## Cosmos SDK Modules

The best place to find an accurate list of the Cosmos SDK modules is the project repository:

* For a list of production-grade modules, see the [List of Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/).
* For a list of well-known third-party modules, see the [Ecosystem section](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/ecosystem) of the Cosmos SDK documentation. 

Some modules are important but may still lack official documentation, like the [genutil](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/genutil) module that is essential to launch a chain. Please consider contributing documentation to the Cosmos SDK to help fill these gaps.

To share a module that you want the community to know about and use, add it here. You can also create a pull request (PR) to add the module to the official project.
