These settlement systems can be anything from spot exchange to derivatives, loans, and more. Any hybrid decentralized settlement logic (with off-chain order relay with on-chain settlement) can be implemented. Paradigm enables diverse and open marketplaces for custom exchange logic and tokenized financial instrumentation.",
