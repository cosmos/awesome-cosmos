  "description": "Traditional blockchains lack what most enterprises require. BigchainDB takes a different approach, one that starts with a big data distributed database and then adds blockchain characteristics. The result is high throughput and low latency, making data-centric and high volume use cases a breeze. BigchainDB combines the all-important advantages of queryability and performance of traditional databases with the distributed, secure and immutable nature of blockchain technology into one package.",
