  "description": "On-chain governance, voting analytics, supply chain management — processes many suspect will yield to blockchains — consume and translate vast quantities of information in all but the simplest cases. Platforms encumbered by astronomical storage costs — or inexpressive data modelling primitives — are unlikely to provide us with sustainable, cost-effective or transparent solutions to data-hungry problems. Our inaugural post, Blockchains as Information Systems, covers these ideas in more detail.",
